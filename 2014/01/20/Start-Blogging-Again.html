    <h1>Start blogging again</h1>
    <p class="intro"></p>
    <p>The last post (also the first one) was nearly 7 months ago. Gahh! I&rsquo;m too lazy for writing blog. So why the heck should I start writing blog again?</p>

<p>I have met a grumpy bear recently, 2 months as I remember, things are always turning complicated when you meet a (grumpy) bear, whichever color it is. Days ago, she asked me something about viruses, security things, &hellip; I&rsquo;m not a security expert but anyone who has interest in computer/information security should know that those questions can&rsquo;t be easily answered in one (hundred) sentences; in these cases, all IT engineers wish <em>sentence</em> was an uncountable noun. The conversation with the bear raised some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>By searching wrong information resource, she thought (or may keep thinking) that computer bots (robots) are computer viruses.</li>
<li>She wants to be sure that her Windows system is clean and not infected by viruses, which is written by some creapy/creepy and oh-you-loser guys.</li>
<li>She want to be safe on the Internet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hmm.. I could just let it go if someone else asks me something like that. But, well, the conversation was just like a 10 tons snowball in OMG! shape going straight to my face. I give talks sometimes and they&rsquo;re often under control; the bear has many super cute reaction (when she heard about viruses, bots, blah blah..) that I couldn&rsquo;t manage to clearly tell her anything.
So, I will spend a little time to share information and methods (from my poor knowledge) by writing some posts.</p>
